prj\CyberElegans.sln is the VisualStudio2008 solution file

After opening it pls. set 
Project->Properties->Configuration Properties->Debugging->Working Directory to ".."
-- it is being changed to "" each time when project is opened on another computer.

With a mouse you can rotate the scene (LeftMouseBtn+move), move it (RightMouseBtn+move) 
or change scale with a mouse wheel.

Pressing "F1" key in the program shows all available commands and their description
(readme_change_dir.png).


To run in "neural network editor" mode comment entire line 176
("worm->rotateWormAroundAnterPosterAxis(90.f);") in main.cpp and recompile
to provide correct initial position of worm body which is connected with neurons coordinates.
This mode currently allows only selection of pseudoneurons with a mouse and moving them in 3D
by keys described in "F1 help", as well as saving to file (overwrites existing one).
